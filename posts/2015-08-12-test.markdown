#### Subsubheader

This is a **post** I am __using to test__ stuff out. The content here makes no sense (or at least isn't supposed to)

> ⚠️ Work in progress here


```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  urls <- readBlogroll "blogroll.txt"
  putStrLn $ "Found " ++ show (length urls) ++ " feeds"

  fontBase64 <- loadFontAsBase64 "IBMPlexSans-Regular.woff2"
  faviconMap <- fetchAllFavicons urls
  let faviconCss = generateFaviconCss faviconMap

  feeds <- mapM fetchFeed urls
  let feedEntries = zipWith (\url result -> case result of
        Left _err -> []
        Right cont -> parseFeed url cont
        ) urls feeds

  let allEntries = mergeFeedEntries feedEntries
  putStrLn $ "Total entries: " ++ show (length allEntries)

  let recent25 = take 25 allEntries
  let recentHtml = renderHtml recent25 "Good stuff!" faviconCss fontBase64
  let allHtml = renderHtml allEntries "All Posts" faviconCss fontBase64

  TIO.writeFile "index.html" recentHtml
  TIO.writeFile "all.html" allHtml
  putStrLn "Generated index.html (25 recent) and all.html"
```
